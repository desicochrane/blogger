### need to show:
gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a mod b)

### can show:
if 
  d|a and d|b 
then
  d|(r = a mod b)

proof numerically:
if d|a then a = d*m, where m ∈ Int
if d|b then b = d*n, where n ∈ Int

then by definition:
a = b*k + r, where k ∈ Int
r = a - b*k
  = (d*m) - (d*n)*k
  = d(m - n*k)

since m, n, k ∈ Int, d|r

visually this is obvious:
|========================| a = 24
|================| b = 16
|========| d = gcd(24,16) = 8

|========|========|========| a = 24
|========|========| b = 16
|========| d = gcd(24,16) = 8


### maybe can prove by contradiction? if there was a greater number that divides r? then it would be greater than the gcd(a,b) ??

definition of m|a
: m divides a. iff there exists some integer k such that m*k = a
e.g. 3|6
if a = 0, then any m|a simply by choosing k = 0
thereform for all m, m|0

thm. using jugs of water:
for some jug with "a" gallons, and another with "b" gallons, assuming a >= b
if m|a, and m|b, then m|(any possible jug filling)

consider state machine representing jugs!

1. Need to prove: gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a - b)<br>
2. Need to prove that the sequence:
A_n = B_{n-1}
and
B_n = A_{n-1} - B_{n-1}
