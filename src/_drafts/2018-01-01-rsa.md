RSA: 
partyA (recipient)
1. choose 2 primes, p,q, at random. 
    <<Problem: how to generate two large random primes?>>
    <<(prime number theorem? in n digit numbers about logn of them are prime?)>>
    << need fast test for primality >>
2. n = pq // small p or q? small |p-q|?
3. find some "e" s.t gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1 = gcd(e,phi(n))
    <<how to find e? randomly search and check>>
    <<need fast way to compute gcd >>
4. compute d = inverse of e (mod phi(n))
    <<how to find d? pulverizer>>

5. public key: (n,e)
6. private key: d

partyB (sender)
7. send a message, m, with size in range "[1,n)"
8. m' = m^e mod n <uses public key (n,e)>

partyA (recipient)
9. (m')^d mod n


m = m^ed ?


1. probabilistic primality test: fermats lil theorem throws false positive with about 50/50 chance. so if 50 "a"s are chosen 1/2^50 chance of false positive. randomly choose from [1,n) and do test. carmicheal numbers are rare enough to ignore?

Attacks:
1. if you can factor n, you can compute p,q,phi(n),e,m (you have the information that the receiver had)
1. factoring reduces to SAT.
