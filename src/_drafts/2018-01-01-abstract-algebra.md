# group

- set of elements
- with an operation *
- closed under *
- inverse
- identity
- associative
- NOT necessarily commutative

e.g.

x + 3 = 5                 <elements/operation: integers under addition>
(x + 3) + (-3) = 5 + (-3) <inverses of addition>
(x + 3) + (-3) = 2        <closed under addition>
x + (3 + -3) = 2          <associativity>
x + 0 = 2                 <inverses to identity>
x = 2                     <identity>
