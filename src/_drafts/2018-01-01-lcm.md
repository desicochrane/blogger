lcm = a / gcd.

because gcd must multiply smallest, otherwise, assume smaller, prove that is smaller then number is greater than gcd. prove by rectangles?

a = dp, b = dq
ab = dpdq
m = ab/d = pb = qa i.e is a multiple.

assume x < m. 
ab/x = y
a/y=x/b 
so y divides a,b.

ab/x > ab/m
ab/x > ab/m contradictionnnnn!!!


lcm(a,b) = ab/d = dst?

lcm(a,b) = dst (s is co-prime with b, t is co-prime with a, can we prove this?)



can also do with prime factorization:
m = p1^a1*p2^a2...
n = p1^b1*p2^b2...

gcd(m,n) = p1^{min(a1,b1)}...
lcm(m,n) = p1^{max(a1,b1)}...
therefore:
gcd(m,n)*lcm(m,n)=p1^{min(a1,b1) + max(a1,b1)}
only two, so max and min must take both:

gcd(m,n)*lcm(m,n)=p1^{a1+b1} = m*n boom.
