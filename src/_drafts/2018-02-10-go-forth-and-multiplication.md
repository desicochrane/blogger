# Go Forth and Multiply


Consider you are tasked with implementing fast multiplication for two non-negative integer numbers. That is:

\\[ \text{Multiply }(a,b) = ab  a,b \in \\mathbb{N} \\] 


At risk of perpetuating the falsehood that [multiplication is repeated addition](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html) we can use the fact that repeated addition of the natural numbers yields the same result as multiplication and come up with an algorithm:

```go
func Multiply(a int, b int) int {
	for i := 0; i < b
}
```
